<h2>GEL Overview</h2>
  <p>GEL was set up to run the 100KGP. The main aim of 100KGP was to generate health economic evidence for use of WGS as first line genetic test within live healthcare system for rare disease and cancer indication with unmet diagnostic need</p>

<h2>What are the Outcomes of 100KGP?</h2>
  <p>Recruitment for 100KGP was based on adressing unmet diagnostic need and either reducing diagnostic odyssey for patients or enable clinicians to make better decision treatments</p>
	<p>With the completion of the Programme we were able to demonstrate 20 - 25% improvement in diagnostic yield for Rare Disease and up to 50% improvement in cancer treatment decisions</p2>
